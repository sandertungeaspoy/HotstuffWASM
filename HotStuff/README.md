`relab/hotstuff` is an implementation of the HotStuff protocol [1]. It uses the Gorums [2] RPC framework for sending messages between replicas.

## Running the examples

We have written an example client located in `cmd/hotstuffclient` and an example server located in `cmd/hotstuffserver`.
These can be compiled by running `make`.
They read a configuration file named `hotstuff.toml` from the working directory.
An example configuration that runs on localhost is included in the root of the project.
To generate public and private keys for the servers, run `cmd/hotstuffkeygen/hotstuffkeygen -p 'r*' -n 4 --hosts 127.0.0.1 --tls keys`.
To start four servers, run `scripts/run_servers.sh` with any desired options.
To start the client, run `cmd/hotstuffclient/hotstuffclient`.

## TODO

* Further benchmarking and testing
* Improving performance
  * Allow leaders to send command hashes instead of resending whole commands.
* Allow a replica to "catch up" by fetching missing nodes
* Add reconfiguration
